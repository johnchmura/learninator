## Creating Quizzes

### Method 1: Use an LLM (Recommended)

1. **Copy the prompt** from the app (click "Copy Prompt" button)

2. **Use this template** with ChatGPT, Claude, or any LLM:
   ```
   Generate a quiz on [TOPIC] with [NUMBER] multiple choice questions. 
   Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
   [
     {
       "question": "question text here",
       "options": ["option A", "option B", "option C", "option D"],
       "correctAnswer": 0,
       "reasoning": "explanation of why this answer is correct"
     }
   ]
   where correctAnswer is the index (0-3) of the correct option, and reasoning explains why that answer is correct.
   ```

3. **Example prompt:**
   ```
   Generate a quiz on Python programming with 10 multiple choice questions.
   ```

4. **Paste the JSON** into the app

**Important:**
- LLM must return ONLY the JSON array
- Remove any markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) before pasting
- Each question needs exactly 4 options
- correctAnswer must be 0, 1, 2, or 3

### Method 2: Load Example

Click "Load Example" to try a sample quiz about general knowledge.

### Method 3: Write Your Own

Create a JSON file with this format:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "reasoning": "Paris is the capital and largest city of France, known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
    "options": ["Venus", "Jupiter", "Mars", "Saturn"],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "reasoning": "Mars is called the Red Planet because of its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface."
  }
]
```

**Required fields:**
- `question`: The question text (string)
- `options`: Array of exactly 4 answer choices (strings)
- `correctAnswer`: Index of correct option (0-3)
- `reasoning`: Explanation of why the answer is correct (string)

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem:** Backend won't start
```bash
# Check conda is installed
conda --version

# Create/activate environment
conda create -n learn python=3.10 -y
conda activate learn

# Reinstall dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem:** Port 8000 already in use
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### Frontend Issues

**Problem:** Frontend won't start
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be v18+

# Clean install
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Problem:** Port 5173 already in use
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
```

**Problem:** npm errors in WSL
- Make sure Node.js is installed NATIVELY in WSL
- Check with: `which npm` (should NOT show `/mnt/c/...`)
- Install Node.js in WSL:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  ```

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** Can't connect to backend
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000`
2. Check frontend URL matches: Should use `http://localhost:8000`
3. Check firewall isn't blocking ports 8000 or 5173

**Problem:** CORS errors
- Backend already has CORS enabled for all origins
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Quiz Issues

**Problem:** JSON validation fails
- Ensure valid JSON format (use a JSON validator)
- Each question must have exactly 4 options
- `correctAnswer` must be 0, 1, 2, or 3
- Remove markdown formatting from LLM output (like \`\`\`json)
- Ensure all required fields are present

**Problem:** Quiz stuck in mastery mode
- Refresh the page to reset
- This happens if there's a bug - report it!

## Development

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with Hooks
- Vite for fast development
- Pure CSS with CSS variables
- No external UI libraries

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python 3.10)
- Pydantic for validation
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- No database (in-memory only)

### Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to code
2. **Hot reload** happens automatically
   - Frontend: Vite HMR
   - Backend: Uvicorn --reload flag
3. **Check logs** in terminal or `.log` files
4. **Test** in browser at `http://localhost:5173`

### Code Organization

**Frontend components:**
- `QuizInput.jsx`: Handles JSON input, validation, mode selection
- `QuizQuestion.jsx`: Displays questions, handles mastery loop logic
- `QuizResults.jsx`: Shows final results with statistics

**Backend routes:**
- `/api/quiz/validate`: Validates quiz structure
- `/api/quiz/submit`: Calculates and returns results

### Adding Features

The codebase is designed to be extended. Some ideas:
- **Question categories/tags**: Add category field to questions
- **Difficulty levels**: Tag questions as easy/medium/hard
- **Hints system**: Add hints array to questions
- **Confidence ratings**: Ask users how confident they were
- **Progress persistence**: Save progress to localStorage
- **Spaced repetition**: Schedule questions for review

See the project roadmap in the original plan for more ideas.
