Generate a quiz on [TOPIC] with [NUMBER] multiple choice questions. 
Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
[
  {
    "question": "question text here",
    "options": ["option A", "option B", "option C", "option D"],
    "correctAnswer": 0
  }
]
where correctAnswer is the index (0-3) of the correct option.


=== EXAMPLE USAGE ===

Replace [TOPIC] with your subject (e.g., "Python programming", "World History", "Biology")
Replace [NUMBER] with how many questions you want (e.g., 5, 10, 20)

Example:
"Generate a quiz on Python programming with 10 multiple choice questions."


=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

1. Make sure the LLM returns ONLY the JSON array, no extra text
2. Each question must have exactly 4 options
3. correctAnswer must be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (the index of the correct option)
4. If the LLM adds markdown formatting (like ```json), remove it before pasting
